# Countdown
An attempt at the countdown problem here http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/countdown.pdf

I got the idea from this video https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/C9-Lectures-Dr-Graham-Hutton-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-11-of-13 by the great Dr. Graham Hutton, author of the Programming in Haskell book.

This script could manage to complete within 5 - 10 seconds, a bit longer than what's said on the video. I wonder if that's due to the eagerness of F#.
